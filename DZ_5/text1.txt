Tracy: Hello, Mark! How are you? Have not seen you for ages!
Mark: Hello, Tracy! Just wonderful! Glad to see you.
T: So do I. What are you doing here? I thought you had left the city after the exams.
M: I was going, but the plans have changed, and here I am. 25678
T: It’s a surprise to see you in the Sports complex. I did not know that you are fond of sports.
M: And I'm not fond of it. I certainly do gymnastics and all that, but I'm not a big fan. And here I am because my girl goes in for figure skating. So I am waiting here the end of her training. And what are you doing here?
T: Shame on you, Mark. You forgot that I have been doing tennis for a long time.
M: Oh, I'm sorry. I completely forgot. And how are you getting on? 12
T: I’ve already participated in the city tournament and won the second prize. 1234567890
M: Terrific! You're doing great! I was always surprised at people like you. How do you have enough willpower not to give up all these workouts?
T: It helps to spend free time and at the same time do something useful for your health. And what do you do when you have a free minute?
M: Well, I also found an interesting occupation for myself. I write poems. Even when I wait for my girl from training, and I have inspiration, I can write a couple of lines.
T: This is also an interesting way to spend time usefully. Something like training for the brain. Some time ago I also tried to write poems, but failed, so I fixed myself just on reading. And what else do you like to do? I mean active rest.
M: To talk about active rest, I love summer sports, such as diving. If I am lucky enough to have holiday in summer, then I certainly go to the place where I can dive.
T: That's not bad either. Well, I should go. My training is in 5 minutes. I was glad to see.
M: So was I. Good luck to you.
T: Thank you. You too.
